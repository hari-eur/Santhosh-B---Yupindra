Explain the reason for your answers.
1.  
#include<stdio.h> 
#define FALSE -1 
#define NULL 0 
#define TRUE 1 
int main(){     
	if(NULL)         
	printf("NULL");     
	else if(FALSE)         
	printf("TRUE");     
	else         
	printf("FALSE");     
	return 0; 
} 

A. FALSE  B. NULL  C. TRUE  D. Compilation Error

Answer:  C. TRUE

Reason: The #define in C defines macros in a program whihc get substituited while the program gets compiled. Here three macros FALSE : -1, NULL : 0, TRUE : 1 are defined.
The if statements finally evaluate only after the macro expansion. NULL evaluates to 0 which is FALSE, Then FALSE evaluates as -1 which means a value is available for the compiler, turns 
to TRUE. Thus TRUE is printed. Else part remains unexecuted.

#include<stdio.h> 
int main(){     
	int i = 0, j = 0;         
	if(i++ == j++)             
	printf("%d %d", i--, j--);         
	else             
	printf("%d %d", i, j);         
	return 0; 
} 

A. 0 0  B. 0 1  C. 1 0  D. 1 1 

Answer: D. 1 1

Reason: In the condition of the if statment both increments of i and j are post which means the value is first assigned and then incremented at the end of the statement. So both i and j are 0 while evaluating the expression. At the end both i and j are 1. In the printf statments also the above reason applies. Thus 1 1 is printed

3.
#include<stdio.h> 
int main()
{     
	int i = 0, j = 1, k = 0;         
	if(++k, j, i++)             
	printf("%d %d %d", i, j, k);     
	return 0; 
} 

A. Prints Nothing     B. 1 1 0     C. 0 1 0     D. Compilation Error 

Answer: A. Prints Nothing

Reason: Inside the if statement first the ++k is a pre increment so k is both incremented and assigned, So k is now 1. Then j remains the same. At last i++ peforms a assign and increment  
(1, 1, 0) is the new expression which has operators comma, brackets, = in increasing priority. First the contents inside the brackets are evaluated. In comma operators the last assigned value is asssigned which is 0. A 0 in if is taken as False. So nothing is printed.

4.
#include<stdio.h> 
int main() {     
	char str[8] = "if block";     
	if(str == "if block")         
	printf("if block executed");     
	else         
	printf("else block executed");     
	return 0; 
} 

A. if block executed  B. else block executed  C. Compilation Error  D. None of the above 

Answer: B. else block executed

Reason: Comparing the character arrays using the == operator only compares their addresses which means here both have different values. Thus the exprsssion inside the if is evaluated to
False. Thus executing the els eprt and printing else block executed.

5.
#include<stdio.h> 
int main() {     
	char str[] = "\0";     
	if(printf("%s",str))         
	printf("inside if block");     
	else         
	printf("inside else block");     
	return 0; 
} 

A. inside else block  B. inside if block  C. Compilation Error  D. Runtime Error 

Answer: A. Inside else block

Reason: The printf function by default return the number characters printed into the out stream. Here only the null character \0 is in the character array which means the length of the array is 0. 0 inside an if is False. Thus the else part is executed, and Inside else block is printed. 

5.
#include<stdio.h> 
int main() {     
	int i = 5, j = 5;     
	if(i == j);         
	printf("Equal");     
	else         
	printf("Not Equal");     
	return 0; 
} 

A. Compilation Error  B. Runtime Error  C. Equal  D. Not Equal 

Answer: A. Compilation Error

Reason: The semicolon recognized by a C compiler means this is the end of line. In case of the if followed by a semicolon it means that there no other else if or else blocks related with
this if block. Thus a else block later throws an error that there is no preceeding if block to fall from.

6.
#include<stdio.h> 
int main(){     
	float me = 5.25;     
	double you = 5.25;     
	if(me == you)         
	printf("Hello\n");     
	else         
	break;     
	return 0; 
}

A. Prints Nothing  B. Hello  C. Runtime Error  D. Compilation Error 

Answer:D. Compilation error

Reason: The break statement in C is used to break loops and switch statements only, here it is used with an if statement. This throws an error break statement not within a loop.

7.
#include<stdio.h> 
int main()  {      
	printf("\nab");      
	printf("\bsi");     
	printf("\rha");     
	return 0; 
}

A. asiha B. abha C. aha D. hai 

Answer: D. hai

Reason: In  the three printf statments, \n means a newline thus ab itself is printed in the next line. Then \b is the backspace, thus b is deleted. The \r is the carriage
return that takes the further input to the beginning of the line. As we have asi, The beginning as is replaced by the next ha. Thus The output printed is hai.

8.
#include<stdio.h> 
int main(){     
	if("May I Get in")         
	printf("yes, Get in");     
	else          
	printf("No"); 
	return 0; 
} 

A. Compilation Error  B. No  C. yes, Get in  D. None of above 

Answer: C.yes, Get in

Reason: The if statement has a string which is evaluated to True. Thus yes, Get in is printed.

#include<stdio.h> 
int main(){     
	int i = 5;     
	if(i == 3, 4)          
	printf("Hai");    
	else         
	printf("No Hai");     
	return 0; 
} 

A. Hai  B. No Hai  C. Compilation Error  D. None of the Above

#include<stdio.h> int main(){     char *str = {"2braces"};     char *str1 = {"2braces"};     if(*str == *str1)         printf("inside if block");     else          printf("inside else block");     return 0; } A. Runtime Error  B. Compilation Error  C. inside if block  D. inside else block 

#include<stdio.h> int main() {     int i;     if(scanf("%d",&i)) //if we give input as 0         printf("inside if block");     else         printf("inside else block");     return 0; } A. Runtime Error  B. Compilation Error  C. inside else block  D. inside if block

This is case 6");         break;         break;         default:          printf("Hai. This is default");         break;     } return 0; } A. Hai. This is case 3  B. Hai. This is case 6  C.
